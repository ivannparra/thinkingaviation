In a previous post, we have seen the VFR weather minimums required for each airspace, but I would like to go over it again since it's one of the most important and difficult aviation topics to learn. The key to remember the weather minimums is not to learn them by heart but understand the reason for having different weather minimums in different airspaces.

So, let's talk a little bit about airspaces. The main reason for having different airspaces with different restrictions is to separate IFR traffic from VFR traffic. The weather minimums for each airspace will vary depending on the ATC capability to see and manage traffic, as the greater the ATC capabilities, like in B airspace, the less the VFR weather minimums required (3SM and Clear of clouds). Do you wonder why? The answer is easy, ATC can see you on the radar, that's why a transponder with ADS-B is required, then if needed, ATC can vector you or other traffics around you. Moreover, all traffic within B airspace is under control, that's why ATC clearance is required prior to entering the airspace, ATC is aware and can see all traffic within B airspace. The 3 SM flight visibility required is for us to be able to see the airport where we are going to land.

In C airspace, there is no requirement to have a clearance prior to entering but you must establish two-way radio communications. Moreover, ATC personnel may not be the same as B airspace, therefore weather minimums required are increased to 3 SM, 1000 ft above, 500 ft below, and 2,000 ft beside the clouds. But, why is that? It's simple, as a VFR traffic, even though you may be vectored, it is your responsibility to maintain visual separation from other traffic, so you should be able to see and avoid the traffic. Remaining clear of clouds means that you can be 2 ft below them, then imagine an IFR traffic popping out from the cloud. There would be no time for you, as VFR traffic, to see and avoid it. Of course, in C airspace that would rarely happen, because ATC will accommodate the flow of traffic. That scenario would be more commonly found in E airspace.

Class D it's pretty similar to C airspace, the VFR weather minimums are the same, the only difference is that a transponder is not required, that's because ATC usually doesn't have a radar (it's not needed since there are not so many IFR traffic arriving at the airport). They separate VFR traffic based on pilot position reports, that's why establishing a two-way radio communication prior to entering is required. 

Now let's talk a little bit about the following airspace.

![1TE4 Airport](/images/1te4.png "1TE4 Airport")

1TE4 is the airport we are going to analyze. In this area, G airspace starts from the surface and goes up to 700 ft, where E airspace takes place up to 17,999 ft MSL. Why does E airspace start at 700 ft AGL instead of 1,200 ft AGL? The reason is that there is an instrument approach at Randolph AFB (RND), IFR traffic on the approach needs to be separated from VFR traffic flying in the vicinity.  The standard traffic pattern altitude at 1TE4 is 1,000 ft AGL. Imagine if 1TE4 airport's G airspace started at 1,200 ft AGL, you would be able to fly the traffic pattern when the ceiling is greater than 1,000 ft because the weather requirements for G airspace are 1SM and clear of clouds; being 1 ft below the cloud is already enough for G airspace. Instead, the FAA has established E airspace floor at 700 ft AGL, therefore increasing the VFR weather minimums over 700 ft AGL to 3 SM and 1,000 ft above, 500 ft below, and 2,000 beside the clouds. If the ceiling is reported at 1,000 ft we are not able to fly the traffic pattern. The ceiling reported should be at least 1,500 ft. As such, you would be flying the traffic pattern at 1,000 ft AGL and you would have 500 ft separation from the base of the clouds giving you the possibility to see and avoid that IFR traffic approaching on the Randolph Instrument approach.

When there is E airspace all the way down to the surface it means there is a precision instrument approach into that airport. A precision instrument approach is a guided vertical and lateral path used by IFR traffic to get down to 200 ft AGL over the airport. Therefore IFR traffic still needs to be separated below 700 ft AGL from VFR traffic. In this case, weather minimums are increased all the way down to the surface. E airspace starting at the surface is used in uncontrolled airports with precision approaches. Some D airports have precision approaches but don't have E airspace down to the surface; the reason is that they have the D airspace around them, which is a more restrictive airspace, it has the same cloud clearance but two-way radio communications must be established prior to entry.
As we can see on the following image, around E airspace starting at the surface there is E airspace from 700 ft AGL, the reason is that the approaches are established paths, therefore, the FAA knows that at that distance from the airport IFR traffics will be higher than 700 ft AGL.

And if you remember, the weather minimum for E airspace and G airspace over 10,000 ft MSL also has a big change. Below 10,000 ft MSL the weather minimum is 3SM, 1,000 ft above, 500 ft below, and 2,000 beside the clouds and above 10,000 ft MSL the minimums increase to 5 SM 1,000 ft above, 1,000 ft below, and 1 SM beside the clouds. The reason for this is simple: there is an airspeed restriction of 250 KIAS for all traffic below 10,000 ft MSL. Above 10,000 MSL traffic is moving faster, from 250 KIAS to Mach 1, therefore VFR traffic has less time to see and avoid IFR traffic.

In G airspace below 1,200 ft AGL, since there are no IFR traffics, the weather minimums are lower: only 1 SM and remain clear of clouds are required during the day, and they are increased during night time so VFR traffic doesn't inadvertently enter into a cloud.

The following is a graphic aid for the VFR weather minimums.

Now that you understand the reason for the different VFR weather minimums it should be easier to remember them for your check-ride.
