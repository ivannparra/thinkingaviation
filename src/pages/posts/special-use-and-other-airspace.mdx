The National Airspace System is divided in two different categories of airspaces. The regulatory and non regulatory airspaces.

Regulatory airspaces are areas in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will make enforcement actions when regulations are not being followed. Examples of regulatory airspaces are, controlled airspaces, uncontrolled airspaces, prohibited areas and restricted areas.

Non regulatory Airspaces are areas in which the FAA does not make regulatory enforcement due to special operations. Examples of those airspaces are: Military Operations Areas (MOA), Warning areas, Alert Areas and Controlled Firing Areas (CFA).

> AIM 3−4−5 (b) Examples of activities conducted in MOAs include, but are not limited to: air combat tactics, air intercepts, aerobatics, formation training, and low−altitude tactics. Military pilots flying in an active MOA are exempted from the provisions of 14 CFR Section 91.303(c) and (d) which prohibits aerobatic flight within Class D and Class E surface areas, and within Federal airways. Additionally, the Department of Defense has been issued an authorization to operate aircraft at indicated airspeeds in excess of 250 knots below 10,000 feet MSL within active MOAs

Within regulatory and nonregulatory airspaces there are 4 types of airspaces. Controlled airspaces, Uncontrolled airspaces, Special Use and Other airspaces.

**Special Use Airspaces**

[14 CFR Part 73](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/part-73)

Special Use Airspace (SUA) consists of that airspace wherein activities must be confined because of their nature, or wherein limitations are imposed upon aircraft operations that are not a part of those activities.

Types of SUA

* Prohibited Areas
* Restricted Areas
* Warning Areas
* Military Operations Areas (MOA)
* Alert Areas
* Controlled Firing Areas (CFA)

**Prohibited Areas**

[14 CFR Part § 91.133](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.133)

![prohibited area](/images/prohibited-areas.png "prohibited area")

Prhibited areas are usually created for security or national welfare.

They are depicted in the sectional chart with a blue hatched borders and labeled with the letter P. Operations are totally prohibited within the area.

**Restricted Areas**

[14 CFR Part § 91.133](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/91.133)

![Restricted area](/images/restricted.png "Restricted area")

Restricted are areas that denote the existence of unusual, often invisible, hazards to aircraft (e.g, artillery firing). Even if the operation within the area is not wholly prohibited, restrictions are in effect, pilots must contact ATC prior to operating within the area.

ATC will authorize the operation within the area or reroute the traffic around it.

Depicted in sectional chart with blue hatched borders and labeled with the letter R.

**Warning Areas**

AIM 3-4-4

![Warning area](/images/warning-area.png "Warning area")

Warning are areas where the United States government does not have sole jurisdiction over the airspace (e.g, International waters), therefore there may be operations that impose a hazard on aircraft. Warning areas extends from 3 NM outward from the coast of the United States. Pilots can enter warning area without clearance.

Depicted in sectional chart with blue hatched borders and labeled with the letter W.

**Military Operation Areas (MOA)**

AIM 3-4-5

![MOA](/images/texon-moa.png "MOA")

MOAs are areas created to separate certain military training activities from non participating traffic. When the MOA is active (hot) ATC will re-route IFR traffic around the area unless traffic separation can be provided. No clearance is required for VFR traffic, therefore they can cross over a MOA without talking with ATC, although it is not recommended.

MOAs are depicted in sectional charts with a magenta hatched border and labeled as MOA.

**Alert Areas**

AIM 3-4-6

![Alert area](/images/alert-area.png "Alert area")

Alerta are areas that may contain a high volume of pilot training or an unusual type of aerial activity. Pilots can enter the area but they should exercise caution.

Alert areas are depicted in sectional charts with a magenta hatched border and labeled with the letter A (e.g, Training areas).

**Controlled Firing Areas (CFA)**

AIM 3-4-7

CFA are areas that contain activities that, if not conducted in a controlled environment, could be hazardous to nonparticipating aircrafts.

Activities must be suspended when a spotter aircraft or radar, indicates an aircraft might be approaching the CFA. They are not depicted on sectional charts since they don't impose a hazard to nonparticipating areas.

As pilots we can find more information about SUA on the left side of a sectional chart. This information (SUA altitudes, hours of operation, controlling agency and frequencies) will help us to determine if the flight can be conducted in the area or if we should plan something different.

Current status of SUA can also found on a dynamic map on the following website - [SUA FAA website](https://sua.faa.gov/sua/siteFrame.app)

So next time you are planning a VFR cross country, take your time, look the chart, identify the SUA and contact the corresponding agency if you have any doubt.

Share with us in the comments any SUA experience or story you have.
